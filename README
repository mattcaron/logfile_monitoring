cview:

Watches your logfile using regexp matches to determine the color to
print the message in. For example, intrusion detection messages show
up in red. I typically run it as: 
   /usr/local/apps/cv/xterm -geometry 100x5 -e /usr/local/apps/cv/cview 1 3 6


The logmonitor and 80-logmonitor.conf are config files, which go in:

logmonitor -> /etc/logrotate.d
80-logmonitor.conf -> /etc/ryslog.d 

respectively. This will give a rotated aggregate log of everything.
